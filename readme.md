# COD Camo Tracker (working title)

Call of Duty camo and prestige tracker built as a manual, player-driven logging tool. There is **no Call of Duty or Activision API usage**; all stats are user-entered and milestones are generated by app logic when progress is updated.

## Overview
- Track COD account level, prestige, and camo unlocks per weapon across titles.
- Generate milestone events (e.g., “Gold unlocked for M4”, “All Assault Rifles gold”, “Reached Prestige 10”) based on user-entered progress.
- Provide dashboards for per-class and overall completion plus a recent-activity feed.
- Shareable public profile planned as an opt-in future feature.

## Features
- **User accounts**: NextAuth (Discord or GitHub) for sign-in; session-based access to private progress.
- **Manual COD profile tracking**: record account level, prestige, and a “last updated” timestamp.
- **Camo tracking per weapon**: set camo status (locked / in progress / unlocked) with optional unlocked timestamp.
- **Milestone system**: immutable events for weapon camo unlocks, class mastery (e.g., all ARs gold), prestige reached, and other achievements the app defines.
- **Progress dashboards**: overall completion, per-weapon-class breakdowns, and recent milestones/activity feed.
- **Patch-agnostic data model**: titles, weapons, and camos are data-driven to support new games without schema changes.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) deployed on Vercel.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon or Supabase).
- **ORM**: Prisma.
- **Auth**: NextAuth with Discord or GitHub providers.
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules.

## Data Model (conceptual)
- **Users**: authentication accounts; own progress and settings.
- **Games**: entries for COD titles (e.g., MWIII, MWII) to keep data patch-agnostic.
- **WeaponClasses**: groupings (AR, SMG, Sniper, etc.).
- **Weapons**: belong to a game and a class.
- **Camos**: camo definitions per weapon (Gold, Platinum, Polyatomic, etc.) plus associated challenges.
- **UserCamoProgress**: user-entered status (locked / in progress / unlocked), optional unlocked timestamp, and notes per camo per weapon.
- **MilestoneEvents**: immutable records (weapon camo unlocked, class mastery achieved, prestige reached) with timestamps and references to the triggering progress state.

## Local Development
1) Clone and install: `npm install` (or `pnpm install` / `yarn install`).
2) Create `.env.local` with keys such as:
   - `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000`
   - `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=...`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=...` (or GitHub equivalents)
3) Generate Prisma client and apply schema: `npx prisma db push`.
4) Run dev server: `npm run dev` then open `http://localhost:3000`.
5) Create a user via NextAuth and start manually entering level, prestige, and camo statuses; verify milestones appear in the activity feed when statuses change.

## Deployment
- Deploy the Next.js app to Vercel.
- Use a managed Postgres instance (Neon or Supabase) and set `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel environment variables.
- Configure NextAuth provider secrets and `NEXTAUTH_URL` for production.
- Run `prisma migrate deploy` as part of the deployment pipeline.

## Future Improvements
- Shareable public profile pages (opt-in, read-only).
- Bulk entry and quick-edit flows for multiple weapons/classes.
- Import/export personal progress (JSON/CSV) for backup.
- Notifications or email digests for new milestones.
- Admin UI for adding new COD titles, weapon classes, and camo definitions without code changes.

## Design Philosophy
- Manual-first: no scraping, no unofficial APIs, no automation promises.
- Future-proof: data-driven definitions for new COD titles and camos.
- MVP-focused: start simple (auth, manual entry, milestone logging) and iterate.
- Relational-first: Prisma + Postgres for integrity, analytics, and evolvable schemas.

## Disclaimer
- This project has **no affiliation with Activision or Call of Duty**.
- All stats are **user-entered**; the app does **not** sync with Activision servers or any COD API.
- Milestones are generated solely from the data users input.
